When use CamelCase should follow:

  1. The name of variables, functions(along with methods) and classes could use CamelCase
  2. The name must linked by 2 or more words
  3. No ambiguity


  1. No `' ' / '-' / '_'` in words.
  2. All(besides the first word, when first word not, it is lower camel case, or upper camel case) words' first letter should be upper.

Class & Object:

  A class is an abstraction of an object, which is an instance of a class.
  Real society, we use `object`. Choose common features we can program a class.

  The cat is an object, because we can program a class named `Animal`, subclass `Mammals`, subsubclass `Cat`.
  `Cat cat = new Cat()` so we get an object `cat`.
  That means the mapping relation between `cat`(object, program) and `True Cat`(Real) is constructed.
